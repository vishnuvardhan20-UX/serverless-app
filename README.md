Serverless App
A serverless application built using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This project demonstrates how to build a fully serverless backend with API integration and scalable data storage.

Features
Serverless Backend: Hosted entirely on AWS Lambda for a scalable and cost-effective solution.
API Integration: Uses AWS API Gateway to expose RESTful endpoints.
Database Storage: DynamoDB for fast and scalable NoSQL storage.
Easy Deployment: Deployment instructions are included to help you get started quickly.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

AWS Account: To deploy and test the app.
AWS CLI: Installed and configured.
Python 3.x: For Lambda function development and testing.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vishnuvardhan20-UX/serverless-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd serverless-app
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the lambda/user_handler.py file to review or modify the Lambda function logic.

Deployment Guide
Prerequisites
AWS account
AWS CLI installed and configured
Python 3.x installed
Steps to Deploy
Zip the Lambda function:

bash
Copy code
zip function.zip lambda/user_handler.py
Deploy the Lambda function:

bash
Copy code
aws lambda create-function \
    --function-name serverless-app \
    --runtime python3.x \
    --role <IAM_ROLE_ARN> \
    --handler user_handler.lambda_handler \
    --zip-file fileb://function.zip
Create an API Gateway:

Set up a REST API in API Gateway.
Integrate the API with your Lambda function.
Test the API:

Use Postman, cURL, or a browser to test your endpoint.
Example request:
bash
Copy code
curl -X GET https://<API_ENDPOINT>
API Reference
GET /
Description: Returns a welcome message.
Response:
json
Copy code
{
    "message": "Hello, world! This is a serverless app!",
    "input": {}
}
